# Mentorness

This repositor conatins all the tasks I was assigned during my internship at Mentorness in June of 2024.

Task 1 included a Youtube Shorts video in which the concept of Foreign Keys in SQL Databased is explained a creative way with visual representations.

Task 2 is an analysis carried out in SQL Workbench on a Hotel Reservation Dataset, the objective was to extract insights that can help the Hotel management increases their profits, there is also a PPT and a video presentation in which I have explained the syntaxes I ahve used to query different problems and talked about some insights that I could gather from those analysis which might help in better decision making.

Task 3 is a PowerBI Dashboard made from a dataset of T-Series Youtube Channel's Video Songs from the year 2010 to 2023, the goal was to extract relavent insights which can help the channel customise their content so as to increase their video engagement (likes and comments) and viewership. Again, there is a ppt and a video presentation in which I have talked about those insights.

Presenting the analysis is quite new to me hench it was quite challenging to figure out on how to screen record along with recording my voice for the presentation but I have tried my best to explain them in the video presentation. For Task 2 I made the presentation first and then recorded voice overs, I then proceeded to record the voice overs and used Adobe Premiere Pro to merge the two. However for task 3 I have voiced the video presentation as I went along in real time because the dashboard was interactive and it would have been very difficult to edit everything together and to be honest I noticed myself to not have a good vocabulary during this presentation, I was using the same words again and again however this sort of challenging tasks have definetly helped me improve my communication and I'm thankful for this internship.
